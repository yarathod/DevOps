1. DevOps:
•	DevOps is a culture and set of practices that combine software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). The goal is to shorten the development lifecycle and provide continuous delivery of high-quality software by improving collaboration between development and operations teams. It emphasizes automation, monitoring, and collaboration.
Sr. No.	Purpose	Tools
Version Control Tools:	GIT SVN
Continuous Integration (CI) / Continuous Delivery (CD) Tools:	Jenkins TeamCity
Build Tools:	Maven
Configuration Management: Tools	Ansible
Containerization and Orchestration Tools:	Docker Kubernetes
Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Tools:	Terraform AWS CloudFormation
Cloud Platforms and Services:	AWS

2. SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle):
•	SDLC is the process of planning, creating, testing, and deploying software. It outlines the steps involved in creating software, from the initial idea to the final product. It typically includes stages like planning, design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance.
 
3. Continuous Integration (CI):
Continuous Integration (CI) is a practice where developers frequently merge their code changes into a central repository, usually multiple times a day. After each merge, automated tests are run to ensure that the new code doesn't break anything. This helps detect bugs early and improves the quality of the software. For example: In our project we used TeamCity for CI tool.
4. IDE (Integrated Development Environment):
•	IDE is a software application that provides a set of tools for developers to write, edit, debug, and test their code. It usually includes a code editor, a compiler or interpreter, a debugger, and other useful features. For Examples we  Visual Studio(AWS Environment) and Eclipse(Legacy Environment).
5. Version Control:
•	Version Control is a system that tracks changes to files over time. It allows developers to manage and record changes to their code so they can work together more effectively, track the history of their project, and revert to previous versions if needed. For example we used Git(AWS Environment) and SVN(Legacy Environment) for version control system.
6. Build Tools:
•	Build Tools are programs or scripts used to automate the process of compiling code, running tests, and creating executable files or packages. They help streamline the development process by automating repetitive tasks. For Examples include Maven is using in TeamCity.
7. Software Repository:
•	A Software Repository is a storage location for software packages or code. It's where developers store their code, dependencies, and libraries. A repository allows multiple developers to access, share, and contribute to the code. Popular repositories include GitHub(AWS Environment) and SVN(Legacy Environment).
8. Continuous Integration Tool:
•	A Continuous Integration Tool is a software application that automates the process of integrating code changes into a shared repository. It automatically builds and tests code after each change to ensure it works correctly. Popular CI tools include 
9. Continuous Delivery (CD):
•	Continuous Delivery (CD) is an extension of CI, where code changes are automatically built, tested, and prepared for release. The key idea is that the software is always in a state that could be released to production, allowing for faster, more reliable releases. For example: In our project we used TeamCity for CD tool.
10. Deployment:
•	Deployment is the process of moving code or software from a development environment to a live or production environment where users can access and use it. It could involve installing software on servers, configuring databases, or releasing updates to a website or app. Usually done by OPS team.
11. Automation Tools:
•	Automation Tools are software programs that help automate repetitive tasks in software development, testing, deployment, and infrastructure management. They save time and reduce errors. Examples include Ansible and TeamCity which help automate server configuration and management.
