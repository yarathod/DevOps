Hello, my name is Yashwant Kartikswami Rathod.
I am currently working as an Application Support Engineer at Capgemini Services India Private Limited, where I have been contributing for the past 2 years and 2 months
In my role as an Application Support Engineer, I am responsible for managing complex application infrastructures, optimizing CI/CD pipelines, and ensuring the application's performance and scalability. 
I use modern tools like Eclipse, TeamCity, Terraform, and AWS to support these tasks. 
Additionally, I focus on Incident and Problem Management, Infrastructure as Code (IaC) management, Version Control, and Source Code Management. 
I have successfully automated key processes, improved system reliability, and collaborated with cross-functional teams to support the development and deployment lifecycle. My expertise in automation, cloud optimization, and Linux environment has contributed directly to enhancing the efficiency and stability of the organization's systems.
Before joining Capgemini, I worked as an Application and Production Support Engineer at LeanQuality (I) Solution Private Limited for 1 year and 3 months. During this time, I was responsible for supporting application and production environments, ensuring system uptime, and optimizing infrastructure for better performance
I have developed a strong set of skills in technologies such as Linux/Unix, Oracle, SQL, Shell Scripting, CI/CD pipelines, AWS, and Terraform. These skills have allowed me to drive automation, streamline workflows, and ensure scalable and reliable system performance.
Looking ahead, I am eager to continue honing my skills in cloud technologies and automation while contributing to more strategic initiatives within the organization. 
My goal is to further grow in my technical expertise and take on leadership responsibilities, particularly in infrastructure optimization and system reliability.
